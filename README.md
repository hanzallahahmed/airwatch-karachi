# airwatch-karachi
This repository implements a CI/CD-enabled data pipeline that automatically fetches hourly air quality and weather forecast data for Karachi using Open-Meteo APIs. The pipeline merges AQI and meteorological parameters into a unified dataset and prepares it for machine learning-based AQI prediction.
